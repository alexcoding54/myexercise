## Intro
It's for storaging my own coding exercise work basiclly written in C  
in fact I'm a old bird in programming because I've been coding for six years  
and i attended the NOI (National Olympic Information Compitition)  
but because of the study work (high school) sometimes i can't concentrate on  
coding  
  
## What
C / Assembly / Python  
My main coding language is C  
and I'll always put my algorithm exercise work written with C  
Recently i'm learning ASM  
and Python is a required course in senior high school  
  
## Now
Now i'm a Senior High student (Grade 3)  
the last year of high school  
and i'm preparing for a BIG BIG exam  
this determines whether I can go to college or not
